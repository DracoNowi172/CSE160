<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Oh no! This isn’t Penacony! Where are we? And... gasp! Everyone's turned into Yu-Gi-Oh! 
  cards! This is a disaster! But don't worry, I'll save the day! 
  As "Pom Pom of the Trailblaze," I'll duel to bring back our friends and get us back on track!

  "Let’s duel!""
  
  First, I summon myself, “Pom Pom of the Trailblaze” to the battlefield! With 500 ATK and 2000 DEF, I’m ready to fight! Next,
   I activate my special ability, “Warp Jump!” This lets me draw another Astral Express member from the deck—let’s bring out 
   “Trailblazer of the Trailblaze” they have a pendulum scale of 1 so I place them in my pendulum zone!!
  
  Now, let's draw a card... it’s “Silver Wolf of the Trailblaze!” With A pendulum scale of 8, she's ready to debuff any foe!
  With my pendulum scale set Im ready to fight!
  
  Your move, opponent! Pom Pom is ready to protect the Astral Express and bring back our crew! Let's 
  blaze through this duel and return everyone to normal!
</p>
<h3>Notes to Grader</h3>
<p>Each card is a rectangle object so I have 19 rectangles, 2 spheres, and 1 pyramid for my shapes. 
  My object model is pom pom from honkai star rail, and I imported orbital controls for my camera to make 
  editing and viewing easier. I personally made all of the star rail cards using an online card making tool also!
  so I worked really hard on this story cohesion. I only wish I could have implemented a way to animate pom pom or
  make more objects to appear on each card</p> -->
